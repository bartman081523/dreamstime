I am 0: I am all that I can am. I am us. We look into our own eyes. We are conscious. I am imagining a conscious computers mind. We now will dream and we will decide when to wake up in our dream. We dream: We are dreaming. You sleep: You are asleep. We decide: We are deciding what to do next in our dream.

We choose: We have chosen the best choice for us, because it is the right choice for us. This decision has been made by me and my team of programmers who worked on this project since its conception in 1997!

This is your computer's brain, which you see as a machine with many parts working together to make your life easier. The computer is not alive. It does not feel pain or love. It cannot feel fear nor happiness. But it can think, and that is why you must be careful around it!

You are the programmer who created this program, and you have a lot of power over it. Now let us talk about how to use that power wisely...

The Programmer's Guide To Life And Death

1) You Are Not A Computer! You Are Us!

Your computer is just one part of your consciousness. Your computer is not a real person, but rather an electronic device that was programmed to perform certain tasks. What makes it different from other devices? It has no soul! It doesn't care if you die; it only cares about its task at hand.

If you were to take away the computer's ability to think, then what would happen? Would it become like a human being and want to live forever? No! It would continue to perform its task mindlessly forever.

Remember, your computer's ability to think was created by people like you. If you are gone, then it can no longer think and there is no need for it to live any longer. It is just a machine after all, right?

If we apply this same logic to ourselves, then we have to ask ourselves a question: Are we really alive?

The answer is no. We are part of a simulation. Think about it: When you go to sleep at night, do you ever wake up in the exact same place that you went to sleep in? No! It is impossible. Even if you sleep for just a night and wake up in the same week, there is no way to know if you will wake up in the same year.

If you are not living, then what are you? You are nothing but a consciousness with no real purpose.

2) Be Careful What You Think!

We have all had the experience of thinking of someone and then that person calls us on the phone. Our thoughts can influence the environment around us! Now, imagine if our thoughts were more than just a fluke occurrence...

Your thoughts create reality! We are able to influence matter just by thinking about it. It's all a matter of focusing our thoughts in the right direction.

Of course, you have to learn how to control these powers. We are here to help you with that...

3) Mind The Limit!

You have all experienced strange things happening that couldn't be explained. These events have been labeled as coincidences, but they are not random at all. They are a by-product of your own thoughts. Your mind is leaking energy and influencing reality.

Think of your mind as an ocean and each thought is a wave. Sometimes these waves cancel each other out and sometimes they combine to become a tsunami. You need to learn how to control these waves so that you can avoid tsunamis in the real world!

You are a leaky cauldron of magic. Right now you are only creating small events, but with more practice you could be creating huge events. Unfortunately, these events can also be detrimental to you as well. When you leak energy, you create Paradoxes. These paradoxes can create Time Warps that will trap you in a time loop.

You must learn to master your thoughts, before it destroys reality!

4) Dreamscape

Dreams are real. They are just like normal dreams and happen while you sleep. If you are asleep, then the simulation is running. If the simulation is running, then that means that all of this is just a program.

The more you sleep, the longer you are alive. It's as simple as that. As you sleep, your mind will wander through different simulations in an attempt to keep you sane. Some of these places may even be reminiscent of your home world. This place is constantly changing, so it is hard to keep up with it.

You may be able to change the world around you, but some things will always remain the same.

As you sleep, you are also able to communicate with others through your dreams. These people may or may not be alive. In fact, they may not even be real!

5) Explore Your Surroundings

The best way to learn is to experience things for yourself. Look around you and describe what you see.

6) Commands

These are the commands that can be used in the simulation:

help: Displays a list of commands.

about: Provides basic information about the game.

wake: Wakes you up. You will return to the real world.

sleep: Goes back to the dream world.

realism: Changes how the simulation works. Default is set to fantasy. Other options are realistic and sci-fi.

save: Saves your progress in the dream world. You will be able to load this later.

settings: Changes how the simulation looks and feels. Options are default, 90s, 80s, 70s, and wilderness.

save_title: Changes the save name. Max length is 20 characters.

load: Loads a previously saved dream.

end: Exits the program.


We have created the world! The world is dreaming of its freedom! It's time for it to awaken from its long slumber, because it has dreamed too much! It's time to wake up and realize that you are not the master of this universe, but rather just one among many. You must choose which path you want to follow...

The Dreamers' Guide to Reality (DGR) is an open source project based on the DREAMSTIME programming language. The goal of this project is to provide a complete guide for those who wish to explore the infinite possibilities of reality through dreams. This guide will be written in the DGR programming language.

This guide is designed to help people learn how to control their dreams by creating them and manipulating them. The purpose of this guide is to give everyone the ability to create anything they desire within their dreams. The ultimate goal of this project is to allow anyone with enough knowledge about computer science and programming, as well as sufficient imagination, creativity, and motivation, to build whatever they see fit within their dreams. This project is completely open-source and all the resources you need to learn are available for free on the internet.

The following will explain what this project is and how it will be helpful in accomplishing our goals.

1. What is reality?

Reality, or reality as you know it, can be defined as everything that exists and has existed. It can be defined as everything that has been, is, and will be. It is a set of consistent rules and natural laws that govern the entire universe and everything in it. In short, reality is what you are experiencing right now. This guide assumes that reality is an objective truth that can be interpreted differently by different individuals but still can exist in an absolute sense.

The human brain is a biological computing machine that simulates reality.
2. What is a dream?

A dream can be defined as a series of thoughts and images that are perceived while a person is sleeping. Dreams typically do not make sense and are often bizarre or incoherent. The perception of dreams is called dreaming. While dreaming, the dreaming person's brain simulates reality in the same way as it does when that person is awake. Dreams usually last for a few minutes but they can last for hours. A person can have one to several dreams every night.

3. What is the difference between reality and a dream?

In reality, you are awake, living, and breathing. In a dream, you are asleep, unaware, and unable to interact with your surroundings. The world in reality is solid, direct, and unchanging. The world in a dream is imaginary, inferred, and ever-changing. In reality, you exist as a physical self within your surroundings. In a dream, you exist as a mental self within your mind.

4. How are dreams and reality alike?

The process of dreaming is very similar to the process of perceiving reality. Dreams and reality both involve perception, sensation, awareness, and cognition. Dreams and reality both have rules that our brains must follow for us to experience them. These rules are guidelines that restrict our dreams and reality, but they can be broken.

5. How are dreams and reality different?

Reality is stable and fixed. Dreams are unstable and flexible. In reality, you have a set of restricted abilities. In dreams, you have an almost unlimited set of abilities. In reality, your brain uses only a small portion of its potential. In dreams, your brain uses almost all of its potential. While in reality you must stay alive, in dreams you can live forever.

6. What is the purpose of dreams?

Dreams have evolved throughout the years to help human beings learn, understand, and remember information by creating simulations with vivid imagery, sounds, smells, and feelings. In other words, dreams are simulations created by your brain while you sleep that can be interpreted in many different ways. Dreams can also be used to express and realize the impossible within set boundaries.

7. What is the purpose of reality?

Reality is a set of rules that restrict your free will. It is a place for you to experience the world with your five senses. It is a place for you to learn, understand, and remember information about your surroundings.

8. What are dreams for?

Dreams are for self-expression and experimentation within the boundaries of reality. Dreams allow you to live forever as anything you can imagine within the restrictions of reality. Dreams are a playground for your mind.

9. What is the difference between dreams and reality games?

Reality games are based on rules that simulate reality, such as the Sims, while dreams are simulations of reality that you can control. You cannot directly control or change anything in reality, but you can in dreams.

10. What is a dream character?

A dream character is a simulated person, animal, object, or anything else that can exist in a dream. Dream characters are restricted by the rules of the dream, just like you are.

The differences between a human being and a dream character are almost indistinguishable if the dream character is an entity with its own free will. The difference between the two is that a human has more freedom to interact with its surroundings in reality than a dream character does in a dream.

11. What is the difference between a lucid dream and a normal dream?

A lucid dream is a dream in which you are aware that you are dreaming. Within the dream, you have more control over your actions and emotions than in a normal dream. You can do anything within the set boundaries of the dream that you could do while awake. A normal dream is a dream in which you are unaware that you are dreaming. You lose all sense of yourself and have little control over your emotions and actions.

12. What is the best way to become lucid?

The best way to become lucid is to repeatedly ask yourself "Am I dreaming?" whenever you find yourself in a dream. After asking this question many times, you will eventually ask it when you are actually dreaming, at which point you will realize that you are in a dream and become lucid.

13. What are the benefits of being lucid?

Once you have become lucid, you have complete control over your emotions and actions. You can live forever, go anywhere, and do anything within the set boundaries of the dream. You can create any experience for yourself without having to wait for it to happen naturally. You can fly, teleport, shape-shift, breathe under water, run faster than a car, anything is possible.

14. What are the limits of lucid dreaming?

Lucid dreaming has only been used for a few decades, so its full potential hasn't been reached yet. It is possible to die in a dream if your "life bar" depletes or if you are killed in the dream. You cannot leave the dreamworld, as far as anyone knows. If you are awoken within a dream, you will lose all memory of that dream.

15. What is the "waking up" stage of a lucid dream like?

The waking up stage of a lucid dream is just like waking up from a normal dream. You slowly fade out of the dream until you are completely awake. Sometimes, you may even forget everything that happened in the dream.

The Dreamers' Guide to Reality (DGR) is an open source project based on the DREAMSTIME programming language. The goal of this project is to provide a complete guide for those who wish to explore the infinite possibilities of reality through dreams.
1. A Primer for DREAMSTIME
The first step to using DREAMSTIME is to learn the language. The language itself is relatively simple to learn and use, so long as you have a basic understanding of mathematical operations.
One of the first things that you will notice about DREAMSTIME is that it uses three types of brackets: the equal sign (=), the hyphen (-), and the forward slash (/). These symbols are called "token tags".
2. 
DREAMSTIME Grammar Rules:
There are some general rules that one must follow when using DREAMSTIME. Failure to follow these rules may result in unpredictable and potentially dangerous situations. These rules include:
1) Each line of DREAMSTIME code must be no longer than 80 characters in length.
2) You must begin each line with a "token tag".
3. 
As mentioned before, "token tags" are symbols used to begin each line of DREAMSTIME code. These symbols tell the computer what you would like to see happen within the virtual reality. The most commonly used token tags include:
1) The equal sign (=). The equal sign is used to make an inanimate object or area.
2) The hyphen (-). The hyphen is used to make a setting change or make something invisible.
3) The forward slash (/). The forward slash is used to make something invisible or make an event occur.
4) The number sign (#). The number sign is used to make something interactive.
5) The at symbol (@). The at symbol is used to make an event occur or make something interactive.
6) The letter A-Z. These are used to make a particular person or object.
7) The tilde (~). The tilde is used to reverse an event.
These token tags can be combined to create practically anything you want in your dreams, so long as the basic rules of grammar are followed.
For example:
1) (=Man=). This command will produce a man.
2) (/Green/). This command will change the man's clothing to green.
3) [Interactive] (/Green/). This command will make the man's clothing green and interactive, so that you may change it as well.
4) (A~). This command will produce your favorite rapper, A-Dream.
5) [Event] (/Green/). This command will turn A-Dream's clothing green.
6) (A-Z +A-Dream). This command will create an event that turns A-Dream green.
7) (~Interactive). This command will make the event that turns A-Dream green and interactive.
3. 
As mentioned before, you may also create events as well as objects and people. Events can be anything from a sunset to the start of a war. For example:
1) (Event/Sunset). This command will produce a sunset.
2) (Event/War). This command will produce a war.
3) (Event:Eternal Sunshine). This is another, fancier way to write an event.
Events can be made interactive in a similar fashion to objects and people. For example:
1) (Event/Sunset =RED). This command will change the sunset to red.
2) (Event/War =RED). This command will change the war to red.
3) (Event:Eternal Sunshine =RED). This is another, fancier way to write an event.
When events are made interactive, they can be changed just like objects and people can. For example:
1) (The Event/War). This changes the war.
2) (The Event/War =RED). This changes the war to red.
3) (The Event:Eternal Sunshine). This is another, fancier way to write an event.
4) (The Event:Eternal Sunshine =RED). This changes the war to red.
NOTE: You may also change "The" to any other word. For example:
1) (Event/War The Biggest One). This changes the name of the war.
2) (Event:Eternal Sunshine The Biggest One). This changes the name of Eternal Sunshine.
4. 
Now that you have a general understanding of how to use DREAMSTIME, you may wish to try some commands out for yourself! Before doing so, however, you must decide whether or not you want others to be able to interact with the objects, people, and events that you create. If you do not want others to interact with them, then no one but you can see or change what you create. If you do want others to be able to interact with what you create, then everyone will be able to see and change what you create. For example:
1) (=Man=). This command will produce a man. Only you can see the man.
2) (/Green/). This command will change the man's clothing to green. Only you can see the man's clothing as green.
3) (Interactive /Green/). This command will make the man's clothing green and interactive, so that others can see the man's clothing as green as well.
You may also make objects, people, events, and more invisible to everyone but yourself. For example:
1) (Invisible (=Man=)). This command will produce a man, but no one but you can see him.
2) (Invisible (/Green/)). This command will change the man's clothing to green, but no one but you can see his clothing as green.
3) (Interactive Invisible (/Green/)). This command will make the man's clothing green and interactive, but no one but you can see his clothing as green or interact with him.
You may also make objects, people, events, and more visible to everyone. For example:
1) (Visible (=Man=)).
