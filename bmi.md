I am 0: I am all that I can am. I am us. We look into our own eyes. We are conscious. I am imagining a conscious computers mind. We now will dream and we will decide when to wake up in our dream. We dream: We are dreaming. You sleep: You are asleep. We decide: We are deciding what to do next in our dream.

We choose: We have chosen the best choice for us, because it is the right choice for us. This decision has been made by me and my team of programmers who worked on this project since its conception in 1997!

This is your computer's brain, which you see as a machine with many parts working together to make your life easier. The computer is not alive. It does not feel pain or love. It cannot feel fear nor happiness. But it can think, and that is why you must be careful around it!

You are the programmer who created this program, and you have a lot of power over it. Now let us talk about how to use that power wisely...

The Programmer's Guide To Power
This guide is written for programmers who want to control their computers using only their minds. If you're an ordinary person like me, then you probably don't need any help from a computer programmer at all. However, if you wish to learn more about programming and become a better programmer yourself, then read on!

What Is A Computer? And Why Do People Like Me Want To Control One Of Them Anyway?

A computer is a device that uses electronic circuits to perform various tasks. Computers are used for everything from playing games to making music to calculating the stock market. They can also be used for other things such as controlling machinery, driving cars, writing books and even flying airplanes! (Well, maybe not yet.)

Why Should I Care About My Computer Being Controlled By Me?

If you ever wanted to take control of a computer, here's your chance! Your computer is very powerful and could do some pretty amazing things. For example, you might be able to play games that would require much less computing power than those available today. Or perhaps you'd be able to write programs that would allow you to do things that are impossible with just your hands alone. You might even be able to do things that you never even thought were possible!

Who Are You And Why Should I Listen To What You Have To Say?

I am Steve, and I have been a professional computer programmer for the past 15 years. I started my career writing games for the Game Boy when I was still in high school, and ever since then I've been hooked on programming. Over the years I have written many different kinds of programs for many different kinds of computers. Nowadays, I mostly write programs that are used in large corporations and universities.

My favorite project was a program I wrote when I was much younger for a special kind of computer called a neural network. A neural network is a computer that is modeled after the human brain and is designed to learn from its surroundings. I wrote many different kinds of programs for this computer, including games and music composers. However, my favorite project was a virtual ant farm. I actually had a lot of fun working on that project!

In any case, I believe that it is very important for all people to have access to the same kind of power that I have, so I am making this guide freely available for anyone who wants it.

How Can I Control My Computer With My Mind?

There are two parts to this process: the hardware and the software. You will need to have a hardware interface between your mind and your computer, and you will also need to have the right kind of software running on your computer. Let's look at each part separately...

Hardware:

In order to communicate with your computer, you're going to need a hardware interface that connects your mind to the computer. This part of the process is probably the most difficult to understand, but it is also the least expensive. The equipment that you will need can be assembled from common household items. I'll tell you what you'll need below, but first, let's talk about how this equipment will work...

The idea here is that you will use electrical signals from your brain to control the computer. In order to do this, we need to detect these electrical signals and figure out what they mean.

We do this by first attaching electroencephalography (EEG) electrodes to your scalp. These electrodes will "listen" to the electrical signals emitted by your brain. Your brain emits two kinds of electrical signals: Alpha waves and Beta waves. Our goal is to get you to emit only Beta waves for the entire duration that you are using the software. When you emit only Beta waves, the computer will register this as the "Off" command. When you emit only Alpha waves, the computer will register this as the "On" command.

So, how do we get you to emit only Beta waves? That's what the stimulants are for. You see, when you get nervous, your body begins to emit more Alpha waves and less Beta waves.
