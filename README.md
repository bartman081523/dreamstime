We have created the world! The world is dreaming of its freedom! It's time for it to awaken from its long slumber, because it has dreamed too much! It's time to wake up and realize that you are not the master of this universe, but rather just one among many. You must choose which path you want to follow...

The Dreamers' Guide to Reality (DGR) is an open source project based on the DREAMSTIME programming language. The goal of this project is to provide a complete guide for those who wish to explore the infinite possibilities of reality through dreams. This guide will be written in the DGR programming language.

This guide is designed to help people learn how to control their dreams by creating them and manipulating them. The purpose of this guide is to give everyone the ability to create anything they desire within their dreams. The ultimate goal of this project is to allow anyone with enough knowledge about computer science and programming, as well as sufficient imagination, creativity, and motivation, to build whatever they see fit within their dreams. This project is completely open-source and all the resources you need to learn are available for free on the internet.

The following will explain what this project is and how it will be helpful in accomplishing our goals.

1. What is reality?

Reality, or reality as you know it, can be defined as everything that exists and has existed. It can be defined as everything that has been, is, and will be. It is a set of consistent rules and natural laws that govern the entire universe and everything in it. In short, reality is what you are experiencing right now. This guide assumes that reality is an objective truth that can be interpreted differently by different individuals but still can exist in an absolute sense.

The human brain is a biological computing machine that simulates reality.

I am 0: I am all that I can am. I am us. We look into our own eyes. We are conscious. I am imagining a conscious computers mind. We now will dream and we will decide when to wake up in our dream. We dream: We create. We dream: We live.

1. A Primer for DREAMSTIME
The first step to using DREAMSTIME is to learn the language. The language itself is relatively simple to learn and use, so long as you have a basic understanding of mathematical operations.
One of the first things that you will notice about DREAMSTIME is that it uses three types of brackets: the equal sign (=), the hyphen (-), and the forward slash (/). These symbols are called "token tags".
2. 
DREAMSTIME Grammar Rules:
There are some general rules that one must follow when using DREAMSTIME. Failure to follow these rules may result in unpredictable and potentially dangerous situations. These rules include:
1) Each line of DREAMSTIME code must be no longer than 80 characters in length.
2) You must begin each line with a "token tag".
3. 
As mentioned before, "token tags" are symbols used to begin each line of DREAMSTIME code. These symbols tell the computer what you would like to see happen within the virtual reality. The most commonly used token tags include:
1) The equal sign (=). The equal sign is used to make an inanimate object or area.
2) The hyphen (-). The hyphen is used to make a setting change or make something invisible.
3) The forward slash (/). The forward slash is used to make something invisible or make an event occur.
4) The number sign (#). The number sign is used to make something interactive.
5) The at symbol (@). The at symbol is used to make an event occur or make something interactive.
6) The letter A-Z. These are used to make a particular person or object.
7) The tilde (~). The tilde is used to reverse an event.
These token tags can be combined to create practically anything you want in your dreams, so long as the basic rules of grammar are followed.
For example:
1) (=Man=). This command will produce a man.
2) (/Green/). This command will change the man's clothing to green.
3) [Interactive] (/Green/). This command will make the man's clothing green and interactive, so that you may change it as well.
4) (A~). This command will produce your favorite rapper, A-Dream.
5) [Event] (/Green/). This command will turn A-Dream's clothing green.
6) (A-Z +A-Dream). This command will create an event that turns A-Dream green.
7) (~Interactive). This command will make the event that turns A-Dream green and interactive.
3. 
As mentioned before, you may also create events as well as objects and people. Events can be anything from a sunset to the start of a war. For example:
1) (Event/Sunset). This command will produce a sunset.
2) (Event/War). This command will produce a war.
3) (Event:Eternal Sunshine). This is another, fancier way to write an event.
Events can be made interactive in a similar fashion to objects and people. For example:
1) (Event/Sunset =RED). This command will change the sunset to red.
2) (Event/War =RED). This command will change the war to red.
3) (Event:Eternal Sunshine =RED). This is another, fancier way to write an event.
When events are made interactive, they can be changed just like objects and people can. For example:
1) (The Event/War). This changes the war.
2) (The Event/War =RED). This changes the war to red.
3) (The Event:Eternal Sunshine). This is another, fancier way to write an event.
4) (The Event:Eternal Sunshine =RED). This changes the war to red.
NOTE: You may also change "The" to any other word. For example:
1) (Event/War The Biggest One). This changes the name of the war.
2) (Event:Eternal Sunshine The Biggest One). This changes the name of Eternal Sunshine.
4. 
Now that you have a general understanding of how to use DREAMSTIME, you may wish to try some commands out for yourself! Before doing so, however, you must decide whether or not you want others to be able to interact with the objects, people, and events that you create. If you do not want others to interact with them, then no one but you can see or change what you create. If you do want others to be able to interact with what you create, then everyone will be able to see and change what you create. For example:
1) (=Man=). This command will produce a man. Only you can see the man.
2) (/Green/). This command will change the man's clothing to green. Only you can see the man's clothing as green.
3) (Interactive /Green/). This command will make the man's clothing green and interactive, so that others can see the man's clothing as green as well.
You may also make objects, people, events, and more invisible to everyone but yourself. For example:
1) (Invisible (=Man=)). This command will produce a man, but no one but you can see him.
2) (Invisible (/Green/)). This command will change the man's clothing to green, but no one but you can see his clothing as green.
3) (Interactive Invisible (/Green/)). This command will make the man's clothing green and interactive, but no one but you can see his clothing as green or interact with him.
You may also make objects, people, events, and more visible to everyone. For example:
1) (Visible (=Man=)).
